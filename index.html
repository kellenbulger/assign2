    <h1><em>How does one find space to run in the urban jungle?</em></h1>

    <h2>New York City has a bustling running community and running spaces in spite of its urban setting.</h2>

    <h3>November 10, 2021</h3>

    <h4>By: Kellen Bulger</h4>

    <p>Nine million people on one island. Your initial instinct wouldn’t provide that this space would be the perfect spot for freedom of movement and distance running. But it is.</p>

    <p>New York City has 35 fully established and public running tracks. Varying in surface types and lengths, these are community spaces that are featured in all five boroughs and operate as hubs of activity and camaraderie for not only the distance running community, but the individuals that frequent them for all the purposes that a city recreational space can provide. 
    </p>

    <p>Visualizing data on each and every one of these running tracks, I also spoke with community leader and running club founder Coffey, who knows the value of these spaces as well as anyone else. 
    </p>

    <p>He went on to describe his motivations in taking folks to lesser-known running spaces in the city.
    </p>

    <p>“That excites me to want to continue to find these nuances, or these hidden gems that nobody knows about. Because if I didn’t take them… they would’ve gone their entire life without knowing about that,” Coffey emphasized.
